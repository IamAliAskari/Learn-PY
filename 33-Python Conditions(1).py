# Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics   ! 

# Equals                         a == b

# Not Equals                     a != b

# Less than                      a < b

# Less than or equal to          a <= b

# Greater than                   a > b

# Greater than or equal to       a >= b

# These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in   "if statements"   and loops     !
