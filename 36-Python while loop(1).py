#################################  Python While Loops  ################################# 

# Python has two primitive loop commands  ::: 

# While Loop's 

# For Loop's 

# With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true     ! 

n = 1 

while n < 7 :

    print(n) 

    n += 1

print('---------------------------------------------------------------------')  

# When it reaches 7, that is, 7 is smaller than 7, so this condition ,

# is incorrect and the  ""While""  statement is broken   !
