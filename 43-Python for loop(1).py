#################################  Python for Loops  ################################# 

# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence ( that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string )    !

# This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, 

# and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages      !

# With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc    !

a_a = ['Howard', 'Connell', 'James'] 

for x in a_a :

    print(a_a) 

print('_____________________________________________') 

for y in a_a :

    print(y) 

print('_____________________________________________')
